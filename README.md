# chess-vision

Software for detecting the position of a chess game in a picture. This can be useful for students reading textbooks so they can quickly set up diagrams from the book just using a photograph.

Currently, the app only works with two dimensional images from screenshots from lichess.org. The next goals for the project are
- Use machine learning to recognize what the pieces look like from any two-dimensional image
- Incorporate perspective in the line-detection algorithms so pictures taken from three-dimensional angles can also be analyzed.
